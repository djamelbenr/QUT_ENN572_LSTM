# QUT_ENN572_LSTM

MovingMNIST & Alphabet LSTM — Toy Example

QUT Lecture: Artificial Intelligence in Transport
A single-file, lecture-ready demo (moving_mnist_lstm_all_in_one.py) showcasing sequence-to-sequence learning with LSTMs for two toy tasks:
Vision seq2seq: next-frame prediction on MovingMNIST
Text seq2seq: alphabet wrap-around (e.g., ABC→DEF, XYZ→YZA, A→B, E→F) with an optional Tkinter GUI
The script is self-contained, reproducible, and designed for quick classroom demos and student exploration.
